# Experimental-Design-in-Data-Science
INF2178 Winter 2020 projects
<br />
 The projects listed here were done as part of the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information course titled "Experimental Design in Data Science". The R Markdown files show the R code used in the projects. The PDFs show the report format of the project. 
<br />
The projects with specific titles cover specific statistical experimental design methods. Each project increases in complexity and analyzes different datasets
<br />
The project titled "Exploratory Analysis on the Number of Playgrounds in Toronto by Property Type" covers basic concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R. It includes things like loading data in to R, giving brief dataset description and creating graphs to explain specific variables.This is was mine and my teammates' first time using R stats to do Data Analysis.
<br />
The project titled "Analysis of Red Light Camera Distribution in Toronto" covers more detailed EDA on a red light camera dataset available through the Open Data Toronto portal. A little bit of data cleaning was necessary to extract hood number from the neighborhood names. The analysis was mostly based on the count of redlight cameras around neighborhoods in Toronto. The ethics of the presence of redlight cameras in low income neighborhoods is discussed. This projected was completed individually.
<br />
The project titled "An Analysis on Income and Education Through the Lens of Visible Minority in Toronto" uses the Education level and Toronto Demographics datasets from Open Data Toronto. In this project my team members and I focused on creating charts and graphs to better depict our results. The use of the GGplot2 package was the main focus for this project. We performed correlation analysis of variables relating to demographics such as income, visible minority status and education in Toronto Neighborhoods. We analyze the ethics behind this kind of experimentation and how easy it is to manipulate the results to skew the results in a certain direction.

The project titled "Does Newspaper Price Affect Readership? An Analysis of French Newspaper Readership After the Introduction of Television Advertisements" was a replication experiment of  Angelucci, C., and Cag√©, J. (2019). Newspapers in Times of Low Advertising Revenues. The statistical design used in this paper is difference in differences. The authors released their dataset and my team member's and I attempted to replicate their results. Our findings differed from the authors as we found that the introduction of television ads may not have been the sole cause of increasing newspaper prices and a decreasing readership.

The project titled "Divides in Development: An Analysis on the Impact of Modern Western Colonialism on the Economies of Former Colonies" was an individually completed assignment which was another replication experiment. The authors used Instrumental Variables as the experimental design method to analyze the effects of colonization on countries today. The instrumental variable used was settler mortality rates. The idea was that colonies that had higher settler mortality did not have strong governmental institutions to govern people and the political conflict that resulted from this impact the development of those colonies to this day.
